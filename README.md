**Project Description**

I have taken the Parameters as a Data. The parameter inculde all the requirments to predict either a person is eligible for loan or not.

I have extracted the dataset and performed Exploratory data analysis

Imported all the metrics to built and evaluate the model

. The model is splited as test_train split

. 80% is used for testing and 20% is used for traing

. I have used five algorithm for better accuracy

. Decison tree
. Random forest
. Linear regression
. Logistic regression
. Support Vector Machine
SVM and Linear regession gave best accuracy compare to others so I have used those two to built the model
